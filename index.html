                  They are always alert and in the lookout for possible crimes, ready to intervene at any time and tackle any dangerous situations.
                  Their main weapons will be the police batons and their bare fists to take down the robbers and defend the city, its banks, and people. <br>
                  The Cops goal is to prevent The Robbers from achieving their criminal goals. They have multiple ways of doing so. They can kill all
                  The Robbers so there will not be any Robbers left to acquire money. Alternatively, they can acquire the money the Robbers are bound to steal.

              <br><br>
              <p>
                  Their only goal is to rob as much money as they can and let their names be known all over the city,
                  if that means taking some lives in the process, they will not hesitate in  killing  anyone.
                  Every  movement  they  make  is  calculated  and always follow a through strategy. <br>
                  The Robbers need to hide from The Cops and steal money. <br>
                  Can these unnamed felons achieve their goal and escape the sharp eyes of the cops?
