Hi my name is Muhammad Raja. Iâ€™m a 19 years old and currently in my second year of BSc Computer Science. My role throughout this project has been to record and develop the sounds necessary for the game and to implement them. I had to take time out to learn about differnt ways of using sounds in games and how a games sound makes it stand out. All the audio engineering has been done by me including recording foley, sound design, mixing, sound staging and mastering.
