# Deranged Senators Cops And Robbers Website

This is the sourcetree for the Cops and Robbers [Website](copsandrobbers.co.uk).

## Architecture
The website is a static site built using Jekyll. We have used HTML and Markdown for the base markup and have used SASS for styling (We initially used CSS but moved to SASS due to the modularity and additonal features it provides)

## Credits
This website has been influenced by and uses some code used by the [LineageOS website](https://github.com/lineageos/www). We used this website as a basis for migrating to Jekyll and as the base for our blog page.
