            We have adapted and built upon the SCSS used in their project to suit the requirements of our website and have
            also added some of our own SCSS files for components exclusive to our website
            From the LineageOS website, we adapted their blog page, 404 Page and we have also adapted
            some of their layouts for other pages in our website as we found it to meet our aesthetic requirements
            and it also provided an efficient way to write blog posts.

                Mirror was used to implement multiplayer use Mirror. This is an Open-Source implementation of Unityâ€™s
                now
                deprecated UNet library. This library was pre-tested, scalable, had a strong community backing and
                already had the strong Unity integration that PlayerLink lacked. We then spent the final week of the MVP
                stage working to port our game to Mirror.
