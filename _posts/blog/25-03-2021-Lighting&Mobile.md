## Hello Lighting & Mobile
Hi everyone. So we are on the final stretch of our project now and the end is in sight. 
The final deadline is approaching fast and there’s still a few bugs and tweaks we need to iron out to make sure this game is the best it can be for all of our users. 
In this blog post we will talk about the introduction of lighting into the game and the introduction of our mobile version of the game.

## Luminous Lighting
We have some fantastic news to share for our player base regarding Cops and Robbers. 
We as a team have decided to make a mobile port of our game to allow mobile users to play our game. 
From iOS to Android this will allow a bigger range of players to play with one another. 
After doing some research and taking inspiration from other big successful titles that utilised cross
platform play such as Fortnite and Apex Legends we realised by having a mobile version of our game and allowing PC 
and Mobile users to play together we will have a much bigger player base that isn’t hindered on a platform specific game.
We have incorporated several features into our mobile version of the game that will make playing the game easier such 
as several joysticks and buttons on the screen to help player movement and combat. Currently we are looking to add haptic 
feedback into the game to make the user feel more emersed in the game. We hope that by having a mobile version of our game 
it will grow our player base, make the game more popular and allow friends from different platforms to play with one another.
